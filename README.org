* diflo
  Software for directed flow and handedness analysis of simulation data
  (including (P)HSD, ALICE, ROOT data formats).
  Part of software developed during work at JINR.

   latest version and the ROOT libraries to compile to
   root branch.
   #+BEGIN_SRC
   mkdir bin
   cmake ../src
   make
   #+END_SRC
   you can also
   #+BEGIN_SRC
   make <target>
   #+END_SRC
   where <target> is one of 'diflo.elf', 'multip.elf', 'sdnopt.elf' or
   'sphand.elf'

** Running
   for running check out help, for command line options,
   you will need root, or (P)hsd fort.300 and fort.301
   files.
